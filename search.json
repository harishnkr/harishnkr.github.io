    "text": "In search for the right hostnames, you end up in the weirdest of places. This post would help anyone in making sure your system hostnames are proper when renaming it.\n\nIntro\nAs my arsenal of systems are increasing, I want a unique hostname for each of them. When we use a variety of services online, the hostnames must be unique but easy to remember as well. In order to make sure no stone is left unturned, I am writing the steps to make sure the renaming is performed robustly\n\n\nChoosing a convention\nSince the names must have some sort of coherence but at the same unique and easy to remember. I am pretty sure using Pokemon names for their hostnames is not unique but I thought I will go with it. There are plenty of reasons to do this.\n\nIt is easy to remember\nI will never run out of names\nIt is fun\nIt gives some sort of personality to your computer\nNaming can be done based on the looks of your laptop.\n\nTo make things easy, I will choose from the Pokedex numbering of pkemons till it relates with the appearance of my device.\n\n\nCharmeleon\nMy first ever Laptop is a red Asus Vivobook S15. The name Charmeleon fits right.\nNow that I bought a heavy Acer Nitro gaming laptop, I dont mind calling it Blastoise for now.\n\n\nUpdating the names\nSearch and replace the names in these files accordingly for a Linux system:\n\n/etc/hostname\n/etc/hosts (you can add the name along with localhost) Usually 127.0.0.1 is reserved for localhost. Adding 127.0.1.1 to the unique hostname is the practice in Debian derivatives and would also work in Arch"

    "text": "I planned to use Emacs full time and rather than building emacs config from scratch ( which I have tried but felt cumbersome to work with) I thought of using DooM Emacs. Hence this post to document the steps that I take on Arch linux so that it helps others as well as myself the next time I do a fresh setup. The following guide is made for me, as well as for those who has some idea on using Vim or Vi like editors since DooM Emacs runs more or less like Vim, with the extra functionality of Emacs.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis guide assumes you are runnig on Arch Linux with ripgrep and fd (optional) installed.\n\n\nSetting up till getting a working Emacs\nStart by installing the emacs package from the Arch repositories. Then run the following commands to download the doom emacs files:\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs\n~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install\nOnce done with that, open up Emacs.\nFor me, I found that some glyphs were not rendered properly, so install the necessary fonts by running the command M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts.\nOpen the init.el file in the doom config and edit whatever options that are required.\nSince I am following DT’s guide, I thought the next step of installing the EviL Tutor made sense. Hence I install it by adding it to the packages.el file.\nBefore moving on, I would like to change the font size, so I uncommented the default font lines provided in the config.el file. But this involves installing the Fira Code and the Fira Sans fonts using Pacman in Arch. Also I changed the font size given by default (as of writing this guide, DooM Emacs is on version 24.11).\nEvery time a change is made in the config files in the doom config directory, make sure to quit and emacs to see the new changes.\nNow you can move on, learn along the way by going through the DooM documentation (you can view it on Emacs by typing SPC h d h). Hope this helps."

    "section": "Partitioning",
    "text": "Partitioning\nStart by clearing some space (shrink volume, as it is so called) from Windows partition manager (Disk Management utility as it is known). Choosing how much space depends on the needs and the past experience. As far as I am concerned, the total space is around 1TB, out of which I have to allocate from the available 950 GB space.\nLet us do a bunch of math to sort this issue out. In terms of usage, the / or the root partition is around 22GB which can be extended to about 30GB at max. I have a separate /var partition earlier which I believe I dont require in this installation. I would rather club it in the root partition. The /var partition is around 20GB which has hit the limit a few times. It is not an issue as it can be easily cleaned from time to time. Adding it to the root we get around 50GB.\nThe /home partition uses 18GBG for now and I plan to use local LLMs in the future, it would be good enough for a start to have the size upto around 100GB or more if needed. Also since the ram could be full from time to time, it would be fine to have some swap partition. My current system uses a swapfile located in the root partition, and I would expect it to use(if necessary) upto maybe 10GB.\nThe /boot/efi partition uses less than half an MB. So it would be safe to make this partition around 100MB\nAdding it all up we get around 155GB. Nevertheless what we have done so far is just a practice to see whether it would be worth shrinking up volume on the current disk which already has around 750GB of space free.\nHence we can shrink around 250GB of volume, of which:\n\n60GB which accounts for / or root partition, /var partition as well as for the swap file\n150GB for the /home partition\naround 100MB for containing /boot/efi\n\nSince the Windows Disk Management asks for input in MBs, it seems easier to input to 216000MB, and whatever is left after the first 2 partitions can be allocated to the /boot/efi partition.\nI use Ventoy on the USB for running the Arch ISO, and it is always better to use the latest image\nAs I have mentioned before, this post is to be used alongside the ArchWiki installation guide (as you might have guessed from the mental gymnastics that I have done so far to calculate the partition sizes). To make things easier, I would create a Github repo to upload files that I create along.\nWhile doing the whole thing I came across another issue that might need a whole post on its own. Basically you need to setup a BIOS password to enable booting through other media. Doing that bricks your Windows pin/password. Moreover, in order to boot other media, you have to change some other options as well(enable F12 boot menu)."

Change to a regular user to install yay.\nMost of the following instructions are automated in the install script from this repo. The changes that are being done is only mentioned in the part below.
