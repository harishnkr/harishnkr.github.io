In search for the right hostnames, you end up in the weirdest of places. This post would help anyone in making sure your system hostnames are proper when renaming it.

# Intro

As my arsenal of systems are increasing, I want a unique hostname for each of them. When we use a variety of services online, the hostnames must be unique but easy to remember as well. In order to make sure no stone is left unturned, I am writing the steps to make sure the renaming is performed robustly

# Choosing a convention

Since the names must have some sort of coherence but at the same unique and easy to remember. I am pretty sure using Pokemon names for their hostnames is not unique but I thought I will go with it. There are plenty of reasons to do this.

+ It is easy to remember
+ I will never run out of names
+ It is fun
+ It gives some sort of personality to your computer
+ Naming can be done based on the looks of your laptop.

To make things easy, I will choose from the Pokedex numbering of pkemons till it relates with the appearance of my device.

# Charmeleon

My first ever Laptop is a red Asus Vivobook S15. The name Charmeleon fits right. 

Now that I bought a heavy Acer Nitro gaming laptop, I dont mind calling it Blastoise for now.

# Updating the names

Search and replace the names in these files accordingly for a Linux system:

+ `/etc/hostname`
+ `/etc/hosts` (you can add the name along with localhost)
Usually 127.0.0.1 is reserved for localhost. Adding 127.0.1.1 to the unique hostname is the practice in Debian derivatives and would also work in Arch
